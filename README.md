## Introduction

This smart contract allows for the creation and management of a custom token. The contract includes functionalities to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens, while keeping track of the total supply and individual balances.

## Contract Details

### Public Variables

- `string public tokenName = "DIVYANSH";`
  - Stores the name of the token.
- `string public tokenAbbrevation = "DIV";`
  - Stores the abbreviation of the token.
- `uint public totalSupply = 0;`
  - Stores the total supply of the token, initially set to zero.

### Mappings

- `mapping(address => uint) public balances;`
  - Maps addresses to their respective token balances.

### Functions

- `function minting(address _address, uint _value) public`
  - Mints new tokens.
  - Parameters:
    - `_address`: The address to receive the minted tokens.
    - `_value`: The number of tokens to mint.
  - Increases the `totalSupply` by `_value` and updates the balance of `_address`.

- `function burning(address _address, uint _value) public`
  - Burns existing tokens.
  - Parameters:
    - `_address`: The address from which tokens will be burned.
    - `_value`: The number of tokens to burn.
  - Checks if the balance of `_address` is greater than `_value`.
  - Decreases the `totalSupply` by `_value` and updates the balance of `_address`.
